<!-- PREFACE -->
## Preface

This is a student senior project for the California State University of Sacramento. Any and all development of this project will end by May 12th, 2024. 


<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Carmony is a second-hand automotive retail marketplace aiming to create a consumer-friendly alternative in the online space. Carmony removes initial or recurring fees from private individuals just trying to access the site. Instead, the large focus on getting partnered dealerships involved allows the burden of operation to be shifted. The focus on connecting private individuals and dealerships also allows for a more secure, online individual-to-business opportunity instead of the oversaturated individual-to-individual ecosystems. Additionally, Carmony is focused on protecting sensitive user data from data harvesters, unlike other competitors.

<!-- Dev Instructions -->
## Developer Instructions

To get a local copy up and running, complete the following steps. 

### Prerequisites

Make sure to have Express.js, React, and Node.js installed to their latest versions
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  npm install express
  npm install react
  ```

Make sure to create your own MongoDB deployment and follow their connection instructions for connecting to MongoDB by 'Driver' and receive your connection string. 
Additionally, install the MongoDB extension on your IDE. For Visual Studio Code proceed with the following:
1. Open VSC
2. Click extensions on the left menu bar
3. Search for MongoDB in the search bar and click install
4. Copy your connection string and authentication information into the ".env" file in the backend folder [here](https://github.com/ahadsyed2/CSC190-191-RUNTIME-TERRORS-MASTER/blob/main/website/backend/.env).

If you do not have Node.js or the Node Package Manager installed, you can download them [here](https://nodejs.org/en). NPM comes with Node.js so there is no need to worry about a second download. 

<!-- INSTALLATION -->
### Installation

Download the zip file from Github, unzip it, and then open the folder structure in Visual Studio Code.

Next, open a terminal.

Run these commands inside of the (root)/website folder:
```sh
  npm install @aws-sdk/client-s3
  npm install @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons
  npm install @fortawesome/react-fontawesome
  npm install @testing-library/jest-dom
  npm install aws
  npm install @testing-library/user-event
  npm install axios
  npm install gapi-script
  npm install multer
  npm install react
  npm install react-google-recaptcha
  npm install react-router-dom
  npm install tailwindcss
  npm install bcrypt
  npm install react-google-login --legacy-peer-deps
  npm install react-icons --save
```

Inside a terminal in ./website/backend, type:
```sh
aws configure
```
This will prompt you for 4 pieces of information, one at a time. 
You will need an Amazon S3 Bucket to be able to store and access pictures on the website and continue with the deployment. 
Next, enter the KEY_ID and SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, the region the server is located in, and "none" for the last option. 

Now, open 2 terminals. One inside of the .../website folder and one inside of the .../website/backend folder.
Type this in each terminal:
```sh
  npm start
```
If you encounter an error because of bcrypt, this is a known error and can be resolved with these commands:
```sh
  npm install --save bcryptjs && npm uninstall --save bcrypt
  npm install bcrypt
```

You should now have a functioning development space and can view the project at localhost:3000

<!-- Deployment -->
## Deployment

An example of successful deployment can be seen in the branch "deploy_test3" for reference. 

To prepare the project for deployment, there are a number of minor lines to be changed.
Here is a comprehensive list:

1. Inside ./website/package.json, change the proxy to the base URL of the domain name that you are going to use.
     For example, "https:carmony.onrender.com/"
2. Inside of ./website/src/hooks/usePosting.js, change line 50's fetch() URL to match your domain nam again with this concatenated "api/postingRoutes/UploadImage"
3. Inside of ./website/src/hooks/useLogin.js, change line 50's fetch() URL to match your domain nam again with this concatenated " api/userRoutes/login"
4. Inside of ./website/src/hooks/useSignup.js, change line 50's fetch() URL to match your domain nam again with this concatenated " api/userRoutes/signup"
5. Inside of ./website/src/hooks/useSignup.js, change line 37's href statement to point to your domain name
6. Inside of ./website/src/pages/UserProfile.js change line 30's fetch() URL to match your domain with "api/postRoutes" concatenated
7. Inside of ./website/src/pages/HomePage.js change line 337's fetch() URL to match your domain with "api/postRoutes" concatenated
8. Inside of ./website/src/pages/HomePage.js change line 792's URL to match the full URL of your Amazon S3 bucket. 
9. Inside of ./website/src/pages/CarInfo.js change line 51's URL to match your domain with "api/postRoutes" concatenated

After these changes have been made, you are ready for deployment. Deployment can be different depending on your provider.
Render.com allows for a direct connection to GitHub and they have their instructions on the process on the website.

### Testing React Applications with Cypress

To test React applications using the Cypress framework, follow these steps:

  - **Step 1: Initialize Package.json**:
    - Create a `package.json` file to track installed dependencies and manage your project's setup:
      ```bash
      npm init
      ```

  - **Step 2: Install Cypress**:
    - Cypress is shipped as a NodeJS package, you can use the npm command to install Cypress. 
       ```bash
      npm install cypress --save-dev
      ```

 - **Step 3: Open Cypress**:
    - When you install Cypress for the first time, cypress needs to create all required project folders and do the initial set up. 
      Cypress open command does all these. 
       ```bash
      npx cypress open
      ```

 - **Step 4: Configuring Cypress and Choose the Test Type**;
     - Once you type the cypress open command, the Cypress window opens and asks you to choose a set of options

 - **Step 5: Choose the Test Type**:
     - The welcome window shows two different types of tests, End to End Testing and Component Testing. In this case we are performing 
       UI end-to-end testing so you can choose the test type as E2E Tests. 

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/Cypress_1.png" alt="diagram" width="450" height="300">
</p>

- **Step 6: Review the Configuration File and continue**;
     - The Cypress window shows that there are a set of configuration files that Cypress will create by default, you can review the 
       files and Click on Continue. 

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/Cypress_2.png" alt="diagram" width="450" height="300">
</p>

- **Step 7: Choose a browser**;
     - You can choose from the available browser; Cypress gathers information from all installed browsers in your System. If it 
       supports the Browser type and browser version, then it lists in the Choose a browser section. For simplicity, letâs choose 
       Chrome browser and Click on Start End to end Testing using Chrome. 
 
<p align="center">
  <img src="images/Cypress_3.png" alt="diagram" width="450" height="300">
</p>

- **Step 8: Create First Spec window**;
     - Since you have created the fresh framework, you need to create the first spec, this also helps to verify if Cypress is installed 
       correctly and able to run our automated tests.
         - Click on Create a New Spec 
         - Enter any name (Example: posting.cy.js) 
         - Click on Okay, run the Spec

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/Cypress_4.png" alt="diagram" width="450" height="300">
